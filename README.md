# VSG_AMP-Seq

I am an undergraduate student at Johns Hopkins University studying Molecular and Cellular biology with an interest in Cell and Tissue Engineering.
As a member of the Mugnier lab in the department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at the Blomberg School of Public Health, I have developed my own experimental protocol and code to analyze and better understand how the virus Trypanosoma brucei evades the immune system. The virus has a switching mechanism in which it can change the expressed varuant surface glycoprotein (VSG) of its whole population upon immune recognition. Using the protocol and code I developed, my lab is now able to use millions of reads to locate and analyze the mosaic formation. This is crucial to understanding how a virus uses recombination to create more diverse combinations of VSGâ€™s.
This project focuses on the way that the different VSGs can recombine into mosaic VSGs that can be expressed to further diversify the amount of VSGs that can be expressed. As traditional alignment software struggles with reads coming from multiple sources (mosaic reads), I developed a program to take those mosaic reads, which we have preferentially amplified based on one of thei initial VSGs and discover the location of recombination to find hot spots of recombination.
